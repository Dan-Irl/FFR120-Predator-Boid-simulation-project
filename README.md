# FFR120-Predator-Boid-simulation-project

In this project we will be simulating a swarm - predator system in a 3D environment.

The swarm consists of [Boids](https://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/) that follow a simple set of rules that gives them a swarm like behaviour. The population of boids will be able to grow due to the random spawn of food in the space.

The predators on the other hand will move around the space hunting the boids diminishing their numbers and increasing theirs.
